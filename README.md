### # Mary Allen 

Hi there 👋 

About me 😊
I am Mary Allen, a CROSS-PLATFORM FULL STACK DEVELOPER pursuing a Soft Engineering Program @ALX

🥰 I enjoy contributing to OPEN SOURCE PROJECTS and I'm really enthusiastic about learning new technology.
I also got started with freelancing and blogging recently.

🙈 Outside the world of tech, I love pushing myself to attain new skills and these range from fashion and design, to baking and singing.... I just love the piano mahnnn.

📚 I love reading books on personal development and financial literacy, like my dad will say you are what you read. My favourite ones are compound effect by Darren in the genre of personal development and Rich dad poor dad by Robert Kiyosaki in the genre of financial literacy 

✈️ I love travelling too even though it has been some time since I last travelled.

💬 Ask me about anything tech or work-related I would love to hear from you
